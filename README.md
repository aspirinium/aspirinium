# 👋 Cheers, mates!

Hi, I’m **Irina**!  

I’m here to chat in **English, Russian, German**, or your made-up language - [doesn’t matter if I understand it 😎](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIs46LzZUws).
Maybe we'll talk **Python, C++, JavaScript, or Java**, maybe something entirely different. Stick around and find out!  

## 💻 What I Do
- 🚀 Play around with new tech and programming languages
- 💡 Work on web development, ML, hardware and whatever inspires me at the moment
- 🌄 Combine coding with little passions in life: nature, landscapes, music.

# Let’s get gitting! 🛸
